My Second Project – Tik Tak Toe 

This is my second project in the journey of learning programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It’s a simple game but for me it’s another step forward in understanding how things work.

🔎 About the Project

I made a small Tik Tak Toe game The main idea was to practice JavaScript logic and also try to make the design look good with CSS.

🧑‍💻 What I Learned

How to use JavaScript "if else" for game rules (win, draw, turns).
Updating things on the webpage with DOM.
Structuring a small project with HTML, CSS, JS together.
Also some mistakes which I will fix as I learn more.

🚀 Future Plans

Add single player mode (play vs computer).
Add some animations or sound effects.
Make it look better on mobile.

✨ Closing Note

This project might be simple, but it shows my progress from my first project to this one.
Step by step I am learning and improving as a beginner developer.
